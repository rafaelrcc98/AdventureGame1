Choose-your-own-path text-based survival game:

This game relies heavily on probability and risk-based outcomes -- it includes a health system that is affected by the amount of actions taken and distance traveled, as well as combat damage taken. Different paths can be taken with their pros and cons -- do you play the odds and take the shortest but most dangerous route, or do you play it safe and attempt to gain intel and minimize combat encounters, at the risk of running out of time?
